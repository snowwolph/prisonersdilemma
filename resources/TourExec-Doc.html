1. 	The TourExec1.1 program runs all 63 rules from the second round of
Axelrod's tournament, and includes parametric amount of noise.<p>
<p>
2. Function arguments
<p>
  The arguments for the functions giving the rules are
as follows (where 0 means cooperation and 1 means defection):
<p>
J  the others player's choice on the previous move (0 or 1),
   (J=0 on the first move)
<p>
M the move number
<p>
K your score so far
<p>
L the other player's score so far
<p>
R a floating point number between 0 and 1 which will be a new
number every time a new choice is called for.
<p>
3. To run <p>
	a. the -SAVEALL option must be used in the Language Systems Fortran compiler to make
the local variables in the rule functions static (ie remembers from one call to
the next).<p>
<p>
	<p>
4. Editing requirements for this compliler.<p>
<p>
	a. Because the Language Systems compiler does not save the value of a function
as a local static variable, I had to have the value as an added parameter, e.g.
JA in the example above.  JA is one's own previous choice (0 initially).  I
also added as the first execuatable statement of each rule an assignment:<p>
      K75R=JA<p>
<p>
	b. In the case of K39 rule a trivial change in the logic was necessary to
avoid the Language Systems compiler's getting into trouble in the way it
processes multiple conditions in an IF statement out of order. The change
causes to difference in the algorithm.<p>
